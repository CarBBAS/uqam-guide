# What are we doing
We know that moving to a new country and starting over from stratch is a hard and confusing process. So we created this guide from the cummulative experience of the lab members who had themselves gone through these changes, and hope that these words can give you a good starting point on your journey here at UQÀM.

Though this guide is long and full of information, it's in no way comprehensive and in need of constant update to stay current. So:

+ Feel free to reach out to any lab member for guidance and support, even the little thing, to help with your transition time.

+ We need your help to record your unique experience during your time at UQÀM (if it's not included in this guide already) to help us improve this guide, and hopefully answer the needs of future lab members.
